# Automaton
Evidencia 1 para TC2037 Implementation of Computational Methods

## Descripcion
The language it is going to be interpreted on this automaton is composed by 5 words:
- Esgal - 'screen, hiding'.
- Esse - Quenya word for 'Name'.
- Estel - Sindarin word for 'Hope'.
- Estellio - 'trust'
- Ethuil - 'Spring', the first season of the Elvish year.

On this words we can find the patterns that some of them share:
- Every word starts with E.
- Words can end in 'l', 'e', 'o'.
- Words can start with 'Es' or 'Et'.
- Every word has the pattern 'E' + consonant + consonant.
- Words 'Estel' and 'Estellio' share the same beginning 'estel'
- Words 'Esgal', 'Estel' and 'Ethuil' all end on 'l'

After finding this patterns, I decided that the best way of implementing the automaton was to make a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) (Geeksforgeeks, 2023). This means that there is a limited subset of characters available. In this case 

#### Î£ = {e,s,g,a,l,t,i,o,h,u}

## Models
### Automaton
#### NDA 1
The first model was one that worked, but was not that efficient because it had many final states and none of the patterns where used: For almost every word there was a final state. The number of states being 18.

#### NDA 2
Then, to try and make it more efficient a model was made with only one final state, there fore less states in total. But this model did not work, because it became a NFA because of the input of 'l' on q7. This could make the automaton less efficient and complex to program. The number of states being 16.

#### NDA 3
At last, the best model was the following, with two final states. This meant the number of states could be reduced to 16 and still work. This last models uses the last state from the first model for the word 'estel', but reduces the amount of final states redirecting the last possible letters 'l', 'e' or 'o' into a single final state.

### Regular Expression

- *NDA 1 ->* e( s ( 'gal' | 'se' | 'te' ( 'l' | 'llio' ) ) | 'thuil' )
- *NDA 2 ->* e( s ( 'gal' | 'se' | 'tel' | 'tellio' ) | 'thuil' )
- *NDA 3 ->* e( s ( ( 'ga' | 'te' ) 'l' | 'se' | 'tellio' ) | 'thuil' )

## Implementation
We first need to implement the logic of the automaton on Prolog. For this it is necessary to implement transition functions. Which means making the relations transition(qi, x, qn). In which 'qi' means the initial state, 'x' meaning the symbol and 'qn' meaning the next state.

### Table of Transitions.
| From     | Input | To   |
|----------|-------|------|
| q1       | e     | q2   |
| q2       | s     | q3   |
| q2       | t     | q5   |
| q3       | s     | q4   |
| q3       | t     | q6   |
| q3       | g     | q11  |
| q4       | e     | q16  |
| q5       | h     | q13  |
| q6       | e     | q7   |
| q7       | l     | q8   |
| q8       | l     | q9   |
| q9       | i     | q10  |
| q10      | o     | q16  |
| q11      | a     | q12  |
| q12      | l     | q16  |
| q13      | u     | q14  |
| q14      | i     | q15  |
| q15      | l     | q16  |

To determine the final state. It takes one argument, which is the final state of the input made.

To make the evaluation the function 'automaton' is used and had one argument that is the list of letters in order of the word. For it to work, first is needed a function that check and iterates through the list. This first check function start on the 'q1' on the automaton function.

The check_automaton function starts by checking if the list is empty, and proceedes to make a comparison between the corrected final states and the current final state of the current list. If not, then the array separates the list from the symbol and check if one of the transitions according to the 'qi' matches 'x'.

On the check_automaton function recursion is used, so the next symbol is iterated and checked from the transitions and so on.

Once it finalizes or the rest of the list is empty, it proceed to make the final state comparison.

## Analysis
The complexity of this model is O(n). This is because on the function check_automaton we can find that it calls itself one time, reducing the number of elements of the list by one, which means the complexity is O(n-1). So by being reduced by the amount of letters on the words, the complexity depends on the input n.

My first idea, was to make the regular expression and make the grammar to help me code in prolog, which I was using based on Warren (1999), after some failed attempts, I decided to make the automaton and use the recursion in Prolog documented in Epita (n.d.) and to understand lists iteration and testing from Treasure-Jones (1996).
